            <p>
                A triangle is a closed 3-sided polygon. Every triangle has three sides and three angles.

               <ol>
                   <li> The sum of all angles of a traingle is equal to 180°. This is called the "Angle Sum Property".</li>
                   <li> The sum of length of two sides of a triang;e is greater than lenght of the third side</li>
                   <li>The side opposite the greater angle is the longest side of all the three sides of a triangle.</li>
